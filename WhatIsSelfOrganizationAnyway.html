					### Influencing Team Evolution

						<blockquote class="self-org-quote cell-detail">
						Self-organization proceeds from the premise that
						effective organization is evolved, not designed. 
						<br><br>
						It
						aims to create an environment in which successful
						divisions of labor and routines not only emerge but
						also self-adjust in response to environmental
						changes. 
						<br><br>This happens because management sets up
						an environment and encourages rapid evolution
						toward higher fitness, not because management has
						mastered the art of planning and monitoring workflows.
						</blockquote>

					Select the external environment
• More than just the physical environment
• What business are we in?
• (OK, maybe you can’t influence this one, but someone
can
• The company’s approach to innovation
• Fast follower or innovator? Are mistakes OK? When?
• Types of projects worked on and the rate at which
they are introduced to the organization
• Expectations about multitasking and focus
					</section>
					<section>
					Define performance
• The principle of selection tells us that the traits that
help us survive will be the ones retained
• Managers and leaders send messages about which traits
should survive
• What message is your organization sending about the
relative importance of short vs. long-term performance?
• What messages are sent if the organization:
• Provides training
• Supports working at a sustainable pace
• Allows employees time to explore wild ideas
• Doesn’t exchange meeting a deadline for unmaintainable code
					</section>
					<section>
					Choose people
• Clearly, who is on the team influences how they selforganize
• Adjust
• Some people are like “glue” and pull a team together
and keep it there
					</section>
					<section>
					Reconfigure the network
• Communication paths (formal and informal) can be
more important than the individuals
• You can introduce or remove flows
• To other teams, experts in the organization, customers
					</section>
					<section>
Energize the system
• Unless energy is pumped into the system, entropy will set in
• Make sure the group has a “clear, elevating goal”† or an
“igniting purpose”‡
• Motivation
• Project chartering: Vision box, press release, magazine review,
elevator statement
• Opportunity
• To learn, a bigger role, to go onto even better projects, and so on
• Information
• Customer visits, training, conferences, brown-bags
